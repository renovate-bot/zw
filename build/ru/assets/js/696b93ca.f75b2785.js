Run programs and scripts without adding anything to `$PATH`,\\n\\n2. Install and run Ruby [Gems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), [Node](https://github.com/npm/cli), and\\n   [Python](https://python.org) modules from within a local directory with\\n   [$GEM_HOME](https://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-environment),\\n   [$NODE_PATH](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders), and\\n   [$VIRTUALENV](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) automatically set.\\n\\n3. Run programs, scripts, and functions with automatic `cd` into the plugin or snippet directory, plus also with\\n   automatic standard output & standard error redirecting.\\n\\n4. Source scripts through an automatically created function with the above `$GEM_HOME`, `$NODE_PATH`, `$VIRTUALENV`, and\\n   `cd` features available.\\n\\n5.

Automatic updates of Ruby gems and Node modules during regular plugin and snippet updates with `zi update \u2026`.\\n\\n7. Install almost everything from [GitHub](https://github.com/z-shell), and other Git providers.\\n\\n- Detailed information on how it works and how to achieve it is found in the\\n  [wiki](https://z-shell.pages.dev/docs/ecosystem/annexes)\\n\\n### Use what you want - not only what you can\\n\\n- Supports loading [Oh My Zsh and Prezto](https://z-shell.pages.dev/docs/getting_started/overview#oh-my-zsh-prezto)\\n  plugins and libraries, however, the implementation isn\'t framework-specific and doesn\'t bloat the plugin manager with\\n  such code, it allows to use of any framework. See our wiki on how to\\n  [migrate](https://z-shell.pages.dev/docs/getting_started/migration) from other plugin managers.\\n\\n### Boost performance with integrated tools\\n\\n- The dedicated [packages](https://z-shell.pages.dev/docs/ecosystem/packages) offload the user from providing long and\\n  complex commands. See the [Z-Shell ZI](https://github.com/z-shell) organization for a complete list of packages.\\n\\n- The specialized extensions \u2014 so-called [annexes](https://z-shell.pages.dev/docs/ecosystem/annexes) \u2014 expand with new\\n  commands, URL per-processors (used by e.g.: [z-a-readurl](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-readurl) annex), post-install\\n  and post-update hooks, and much more.\\n\\n### Keep it clean and consistent {#keep-it-clean-and-consistent}\\n\\n- The system does not use `$FPATH`, loading multiple plugins doesn\'t clutter `$FPATH` with the same number of entries\\n  (e.g. `10`, `15`, or more). Code is immune to `KSH_ARRAYS` and other options typically causing compatibility problems.\\n\\n### Focus on What Matters {#focus-on-what-matters}\\n\\n- Provides [reports and statistics](https://z-shell.pages.dev/docs/guides/commands#reports-and-statistis) and allows to\\n  manage:\\n\\n- **aliases**, **functions**, **bindkeys**, **zle widgets**, **zstyles**,\\n  [completions](https://z-shell.pages.dev/docs/guides/commands#completions-management), `PATH`, and `FPATH` elements.\\n\\n- Allows to quickly [familiarize](https://z-shell.pages.dev/docs/guides/benchmark) oneself with a new plugin and\\n  provides rich and easy-to-digest information that might be helpful on various occasions.\\n\\n- Supports the unloading of plugins and the ability to list, (un)install, and **selectively disable**, **enable**\\n  plugin\'s completions.\\n\\n### Documentation {#documentation}\\n\\nZI Wiki pages are often improved and updated.
